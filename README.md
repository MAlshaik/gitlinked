# GitLinked

"GitLinked" aims to bridge the existing gap between open-source project developers and prospective contributors by establishing a marketplace that fuses the project-centric nature of GitHub with the professional networking prowess and social aspect of LinkedIn. GitHub excels as a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects, yet it lacks a social networking dimension to foster interpersonal connections based on skills and interests. On the other hand, LinkedIn is a robust platform for professional networking but doesnâ€™t offer a direct pathway to engage with projects that align with a user's skills and interests. GitLinked is conceived as a hybrid solution, combining the strengths of GitHub and LinkedIn to recommend projects and collaborators, thereby cultivating both social and professional connections among individuals with similar interests.
